The MultiPOS project is starting the phase 2 development. Phase 1 was mainly for testing if all POS machines are apple to process transactions seamlessly.   With Phase 2, the company decided to integrate basic UI functionality  and have expanded the item types inside a transaction.  See requirements below:

Types of transactions :
-	Sale Transaction
o	A sale transaction can contain several SaleItems
o	A sale transaction can contain at most 1 DiscountItem
o	A sale transaction can contain at most 1 TaxItem
o	The Transaction Amount is computed as  : the total sale item amount + taxitem amount â€“ discountitem amount
o	The SaleItem , DiscountItem and TaxItem can be voidable. If voided, the amount  will not be factored in the computation.

-	Mo Sale Transaction
o	The no sale tran will contain 1 NoSaleItem
o	The tran amount is equal to the no sale item amount
o	The NoSaleItem can be voided. . If voided, the amount  will not be factored in the computation.

The other functionalities for printing the transactions and showing summary will remain the same.

Here are some design  requirements
1.	All item types ( SaleItem, DiscountItem, TaxItem, NoSaleItem) must implement the ILineItem.
2.	The ILineItem interface has these 2 properties : Price  (Decimal), IsVoided (Boolean)  and 1 method VoidTransaction  (the implementation of VoidTransaction is to set the IsVoided property to true)
